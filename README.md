SimpleJava is a Java API to simply the use of Java for anyone! This API includes a simple file management system, a time system, and much more! This API will keep on expanding so please give any ideas you have to make this API better!

##Features
- Delay Code for a set amount of milliseconds
- Create a Schedule, run code a set amount of times with an interval
- Read the contents of a file
- Set the contents of a file
- Get the extension of a file
- Get the amount of lines in a file
- Log into your SQL database
- Easily create an SQL user database with configurable user information containing usernames, passwords, genders, emails, names, and age.

Much more is to come! Any ideas are welcome!

## Important Notes
When using the SQL libraries, you must have the MySQL JDBC Driver (http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.38.zip) from MySQL as another referenced library in your project (API) (Just know that the company SQL is in no way related to this project).

## Author
This library is being developed by Daniel Shirvani.
