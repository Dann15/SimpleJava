# SimpleJava
SimpleJava is a Java API to simply the use of Java for anyone! This API includes a simple file managment system, a time system, and much more! I will begin putting JAR files on this Git Repo when the project is finished.

## Important Notes
When using the SQL libraries, you must have the MySQL JDBC Driver (http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.38.zip) as another referenced library in your project (API).

## Author
This library is being developed by Daniel Shirvani.
